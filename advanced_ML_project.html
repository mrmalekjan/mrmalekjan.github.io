            <h1>Advanced Machine Learning Course Project</h1>
            
            <div class="section--page">
                <p>As part of my MSc studies, I undertook a project in the Advanced Machine Learning course where I reproduced and implemented the research paper "An Attention-Based Deep Learning Approach for Sleep Stage Classification with Single-Channel EEG" (IEEE TNSRE, 2021) using Python and PyTorch.</p>
                
                <p>The goal of the project was to simulate the proposed AttnSleep model, an attention-based deep learning framework designed for automatic sleep stage classification from EEG signals.</p>
                
                <p>The implementation required building the full pipeline, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN):</strong> to capture both low- and high-frequency features from raw EEG signals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR):</strong> to enhance feature representation by modeling inter-dependencies between extracted features.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporal Context Encoder (TCE):</strong> to model temporal dependencies in sleep patterns using multi-head self-attention with causal convolutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Class-Aware Loss Function:</strong> to address class imbalance commonly present in physiological sleep datasets.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>I trained and tested the model on publicly available EEG datasets (such as Sleep-EDF), evaluated its performance against baseline methods, and confirmed that the reproduced model achieved comparable results to the reported benchmarks.</p>
                
                <p>Through this project, I gained extensive hands-on experience with deep learning for time-series biosignals, attention mechanisms, and practical challenges such as imbalanced medical data, model optimization, and reproducibility of research code.</p>
                
                <p>This project strengthened my expertise in applying advanced deep learning architectures to healthcare-related signal processing problems and gave me practical insights into bridging theoretical research with implementation.</p>
